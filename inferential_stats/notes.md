## Inferential Statistics

#### 1. Probability Theory

Problem: You have 3 red and 2 blue balls in a bag. And if you get continuously 4 red balls you will win 150INR otherwise you have to pay 10INR.

Solution:
1. Find all possible combination [Sample Set]
2. Find probability of each combination [combination of r.v.]
3. Use probability to estimate profit/loss for each player

Let X is random variable i.e. X = number of red balls\
So, S = sample set\

P(X=0) = (2/5)^4\
P(X=4) = (3/5)^4
