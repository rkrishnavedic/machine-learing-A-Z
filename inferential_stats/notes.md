## Inferential Statistics

#### 1. Probability Theory

Problem: You have 3 red and 2 blue balls in a bag. And if you get continuously 4 red balls you will win 150INR otherwise you have to pay 10INR.

Solution:
1. Find all possible combination [Sample Set]
2. Find probability of each combination [combination of r.v.]
3. Use probability to estimate profit/loss for each player

Let X is random variable i.e. X = number of red balls\
So, S = sample set\

Chart out of P(X) is called as Probability distribution chart\
Say\

P(X=2) = 0.347\
P(X=1) = 0.16\

And total players = 1000, then probably there would be 160 people getting 1 red ball in set of 4 they select\

1. what is avg number of red balls appear wrt X?\
E(X) = x_1 * P(X=x_1) + x_2 * P(X=x_2) + ... = 2.385 (say this is expectation of X)\

#### 2. Normal Distribution

X be normal(mu, sigma)\

Then, mu = E(X) and sigma^2 = variance(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2\
\
<br/>
P(25<X<50) = ? if mu = 35 and sigma = 5\


P(25<X<50) = P(X<50)-P(X<=25)\
